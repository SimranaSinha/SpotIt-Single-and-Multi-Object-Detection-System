# Milestone 1 — Object Identification & Deep Learning Model Evaluation

This project focuses on building a custom image dataset around a single real-world object and evaluating multiple deep learning models to determine the most suitable approach for object recognition.

---

📌 Project Objectives

This milestone consists of two main components:

1️⃣ Unique Object Dataset Creation (Individual Task)

Each student was required to:
	•	Identify one unique physical object
	•	Generate at least 100 images of that object
	•	Ensure variation in:
	•	Angles
	•	Lighting conditions
	•	Backgrounds
	•	Distance and orientation
	•	Upload all images to the shared group folder

This step ensures dataset diversity, which is essential for training robust computer vision models.

2️⃣ Deep Learning Model Development 
	•	Combined all individual object datasets
	•	Prepared and organized the dataset for training
	•	Implemented and tested multiple deep learning models
	•	Compared performance across models
	•	Identified the best-performing model for this dataset

---

🧠 Models Evaluated

The following deep learning approaches were tested:
	•	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN-based models)
	•	Transfer Learning models (pretrained architectures)
	•	Custom architectures where applicable

Each model was trained and evaluated under the same conditions for fair comparison.

---

📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Model performance was measured using:
	•	Accuracy
	•	F1-Score
	•	Confusion Matrix
	•	Classification Report

These metrics helped assess both overall performance and class-level behavior.

---

🏆 Best Model Selection

- The final model was chosen based on:
	•	Highest test accuracy
	•	Strong macro F1-score
	•	Balanced performance across classes
	•	Stable training behavior (no overfitting or instability)

The selected model is the most suitable for this dataset and object recognition task.
